    <h1>Web Host Assignment</h1>
    
    <h2><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a></h2>
    
    <p>    <p>GoDaddy is a dedicated hosting provider that has a very wide range of services such as e-commerce solutions, SSL certificates, professional business email accounts, a website builder, and more. Their dedicated server base means that GoDaddy has their servers all to themselves, meaning that they do not need to rely on a third party to run and maintain their variety of services. GoDaddy offers four plans for your individual needs: Basic, starting at 6.99/mo, Premium, starting at 13.99/mo, Commerce starting at 14.99/mo, and Commerce Plus, starting at 29.99/mo. As the price increases, so does the amount of options available to you. The basic plan has core options to choose from such as an easy-to-use website builder, a custom domain connection, SSL certification to let your customers know your website is safe, and other features. A plan such as Commerce Plus allows one to take advantage of all of the previous plan's features, as well as support for an unlimited catalog of items for selling, up to 1,000 external marketplace and social media sales per month, and an automatic sales tax calculator. A small business owner reviewed GoDaddy with 4.5/5 stars, stating that it is the "most reliable and secure hosting platform for everyone and everywhere." One con that some online have experienced with GoDaddy is their customer support, which seems to be under-provided with enough tools to handle complicated website issues. GoDaddy is one of the largest and most expansive, yet one of the easiest-to-use web hosting services out there, even without any technical training, anyone can make a website on GoDaddy from even their cell phone.</p>
      <h2><a href="https://kinsta.com">Kinsta</a></h2>
    
    <p>Kinsta is a high-quality hosting provider renowned for its premium managed WordPress hosting services. They offer a range of plans designed to cater to different website needs, including e-commerce solutions, SSL certificates, and expertly managed WordPress hosting. They offer support for languages and frameworks, such as NodeJS, PHP, Ruby, Python, and more, and make it easy to connect with your GitHub, BitBucket, or GitLab repository and automate deployments. Kinsta's selling point lies in its utilization of the Google Cloud Platform, ensuring top-tier performance and reliability. They provide users with a choice of plans, starting with the Starter plan at $30/month, featuring essential WordPress optimizations, automatic daily backups, and a content delivery network (CDN) for enhanced speed. As you scale up, Kinsta offers more advanced plans such as Pro, Business, and Enterprise, each adding features like free migrations, uptime monitoring, and multisite support. Kinsta consistently receives high praise from users for its exceptional speed and, as many online reviewers point out, a responsive customer support. One minor drawback mentioned in some reviews is the cost, as Kinsta positions itself as a premium hosting service. Kinsta still remains a top choice for those seeking top-notch managed WordPress hosting with a strong emphasis on performance and reliability.</p>
      <h2><a href="https://www.siteground.com">Siteground</a></h2>
    
    <p>SiteGround, from what I found to be a respected hosting provider, boasts a wide spectrum of services tailored to diverse online needs. Their offerings encompass web hosting, WordPress hosting, cloud hosting, and dedicated servers, along with a user-friendly website builder and domain registration services. One of SiteGround's standout features is its commitment to performance and security, with solid-state drives (SSDs), free SSL certificates, and proactive security measures, earning them a reputation for reliability. They offer three shared hosting plans: StartUp, GrowBig, and GoGeek, each catering to varying levels of website traffic and features. The StartUp plan, priced from $6.99 per month, includes the essential features such as a CDN and free website builder, making it ideal for beginners. The GrowBig and GoGeek plans, starting at $9.99 and $14.99 per month respectively, offer more advanced functionalities such as premium support and advanced caching. The customer reviews I found often praise SiteGround's exceptional customer service, characterized by knowledgeable and responsive support teams. Despite this, a few reviews noted that as SiteGround continues to grow, it has experienced some minor declines in performance and simplicity. SiteGround has caught my eye as a reputable hosting choice, particularly for those seeking reliable performance and top-notch support for their websites.</p>
    
    <h2>My Overall Best Pick</h2>
    <p> Siteground I think would stand out to those more experienced in the field of computer science, due to many reviews praising the much more experienced customer service than its competitor, GoDaddy. This could reduce the frustration of those more experienced who may have issues that require more experience. For a word-press enthusiast, then that is where Kinsta excels. WordPress offers exceptional speed and scalability, making those with high-traffic sites consider Kinsta as a more attractive option. For me, my pick would have to be GoDaddy, for its extensive service offerings and super easy-to-use approach. GoDaddy has enough ease of use to host a small or medium business, but the resources and support to easily integrate a large corporation onto their servers. As someone with no background in computer science, website building, or graphic design, having the ability to create a website so easily I could do it on my phone, and run it in the same place, would be why I think GoDaddy attracts me the most. </p>
