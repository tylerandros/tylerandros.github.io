    <h1>My Favorite States Websites</h1>

    
    <h2>Number 5: <a href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Maryland.gov</a></h2>
<p>In my opinion, Maryland has the worst website. The first thing that stands out to me is the lack of a front page. The loading time has a small delay, but nothing too impactful. There is nothing to scroll down to, as the initial front page has a search bar with some recommended searches below, such as COVID-19, with a tab next to the search bar allowing you to chat with a customer service agent. On the right, is the explore section of the website, and on the bottom, there are some links to a portal for residents, a link to common Maryland departments, and others. Sounds pretty good so far. But then there's the design. This has got to be one of the most annoying designs on a front page I've seen in a while. It feels like it's trying too hard, making this experience assualtingly painful on my eyes. The first thing that struck me across the face as annoying is that the search bar is the most prominent part of the front page. The organization of the page makes it feel like I need to know what I'm looking for to utilize the website. You can't scroll down past this, as there is no more website. You need to either click on one of the many links strewn across the abrasive red page or search for what you're looking for to access any useful parts of the website. Why do I need to do this? Why can't I just click a dropdown to display everything in one subject, or scroll until I find what I'm looking for, with the option to look things up? Why am I being gate-kept to this one, over-condensed page before I can access the rest of the website? WHY DOES THE EXPLORE PAGE TAKE UP A THIRD OF THE SCREEN, ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF ALL PLACES, IS COMPLETELY BLACK, AND GIVES ME NO OPTION TO CLOSE IT? I CAN'T DROP DOWN ANY OF THE SECTIONS IN THE EXPLORE PAGE, AND I AM FORCE-FED THIS TERRIBLE DESIGN. ! All-in-all, it's pretty obvious this website initially began as a mobile website. The side bar you can actually close on mobile, with the only problem being that EVERYTHING ELSE WAS MADE FOR COMPUTER! EVERY LITTLE THING THAT FIT NICELY ON MY LAPTOP NOW TAKES UP MY ENTIRE SCREEN ON MY PHONE, AND I NEED TO SCROLL FOR YEARS JUST TO REACH THE BOTTOM OF MY SCREEN AFTER CLICKING ONE OF THE LINKS IN THE EXPLORE TAB! WHY MARYLAND? WHY DID YOU THIS? HOW DID SOMEONE BUILD THIS? Anyways, all the standard stuff is there, privacy policy and such at the bottom, and after clicking on the links, the 2/3 of my computer screen I actually am allowed to see is pretty good. clicking on Jobs, for example, takes me to a different area of the website where I can scroll down and find an organized little section of relevant sub-sections of the job section, with little minimalist graphics quickly showing me where clicking on said graphic will guide me. I can continue to scroll for YouTube videos and Twitter posts about the section I'm in. The color palette is fine, with a nice white, black, and blue blend that's innocent and plain, and the page covers everything I may need in a way that's decently pleasant to look at. This kind of stuff is inherent to all of the websites on this list, so it doesn't get enough points from that to make it higher on this list. The front page was built for mobile, and the rest of the website was built for a computer screen, and that's why Maryland is going in my number 5 spot.</p>
    
<h2>Number 4: <a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov/">Arkansas.gov</a></h2>
    <p>At number 4 is Arkansas. The website is just too much to look at. Information and photos are all over the place. There's a lot of repeated information that just feels redundant, and inefficient, cluttering the space. On top of this, and I'm going to mention this a lot, the big search bar that pops up in the middle of the screen is annoying to me. With redundant information all over the front page and the messy design, I feel trapped in using the search bar as it's a chore to look through the rest of the front page. The only thing I like about it is that there are significant events listed towards the bottom, which can be somewhat helpful if you live in one of the big cities, but odds are most people aren't looking there for all of their information about events. I also dislike how laggy scrolling through the website is. It's only a little slow to load, but I can't scroll down or up without the sheer amount of photos and features causing my computer to lag trying to catch up. Clicking on one of the links such as "moving to Arkansas" takes me to a pretty bland numbered list that, like many PowerPoint presentations with hundreds of words on each slide, it's annoying to read. However, halfway down are these little infographics that are very simple and clean, telling you some fairly common things you should know before moving to Arkansas such as where your nearest library or public school is. With the search bar being relegated to the top right of the screen without becoming overly small is actually kind of nice, but half the page is still bad. The page has a tough time re-sizing as it takes a bit for my computer to catch up, but it does it alright, with many pictures just going away when you make the web page smaller. It's also not really the greatest on mobile, with some much-needed condensing happening in a couple of parts of the website, but it still being laggy, and takes me so long to scroll down, I still feel forced to use the search bar that you need to scroll back up on. It's a pain to navigate and use, and that's why Arkansas's website is resting at number 4.</p>
    
    <h2>Number 3: <a href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html">Maine.gov</a></h2>
    <p> Number 3 is Maine.gov. As I’ve mentioned before, I am not a fan of the search bar being the centerpiece of the first thing you see to represent Maine. If I don’t know what I’m looking for, I have to look at the unbearably small font that, although is the same font that Alaska’s website uses, but unlike Alaska, the page is much more spread out, meaning I have to scroll through a lot of words and a lot of sentences just to understand what I’m supposed to be looking at. I like the photo of the capitol building, but again the search bar completely blocks it out, and with it being at the top, I have to scroll all the way back up from reading all those tiny words just to get somewhere else. I like how information on COVID-19 is right down from the top, and then a little farther down there’s a photo that moves how you scroll associated with Maine’s outdoor attractions. It’s catchy but not too abrasive and lists out some popular Maine attractions and other outdoor necessities such as hunting and fishing licenses. Scrolling down, there is a very unique interactive map of Maine that allows you to filter icons showing the locations of state parks, DMV’s, courthouses, and others. This is my favorite section, as it is unique to Maine’s website compared to the others that are assigned. There is a cute, minimalist graphic capping the bottom of the page with a lighthouse, as well as some fun numbers such as the amount of visits to Maine.gov, and how many vehicle registrations have been renewed in the past week. Normally I may call this a waste of space as it doesn’t even really have a design purpose, but it fits into the format of the website, so it’s not terrible. What I don’t like is how most of the web pages that you get to by clicking on a link are just bullet points with small, basic, and crowded font. Clicking on “Elections and Voting” takes me to a page with a random photo of water under a bridge taking up space at the top, and moves the search bar to this awkward place where the top half of the search bar cuts through the bottom right of the photo. It’s bullet points all the way down, which makes for a lot of reading, and not a lot of enjoyment. Pulling this website up on mobile is pretty similar to most websites. It just stacks all of the photos on top of each other, making me take many seconds to scroll through just the first page. What I do like about the mobile version however is the three little lines that you can usually press to pull up a quick menu. It’s relocated from the top of the webpage, into the quick menu at the top of each webpage that you can pull from the side with the three little lines. It pulls up a search bar, and many relevant categories such as visitors or businesses, and has an easy-to-read font and its own associated minimalist photo. I wish the three little lines were visible no matter how far you scroll down, as long as you scroll back up a little bit they’ll pop back up. It’s a good feature that all of these websites should have. Maine.gov strikes this awkward balance between simplicity and accessibility. It’s somewhat accessible, with an interactive map and relevant topics that can be somewhat easy to find, and is simple, but sometimes a little too simple, with terrible-looking text that stands out so much, that it feels rather lazy. There’s a way to do simple text in a simple way, like my number two, but Maine just doesn’t quite do it right, putting it in my number 3 spot. </p>
    
    
<h2> Number 2: <a href="https://www.alaska.gov/">Alaska.gov</a></h2>
    <p>At number 2, is Alaska. Alaska’s website is outdated. The font is small and basic, it doesn’t fill the whole page, with pictures of mountains bordering the web page, and contains mid-quality png’s that somewhat stand out against the light blue background. There is a taskbar at the top of the website that is disjointed from the rest of the website, is very small, and omits the search bar. With all that said, I still like this website. You open up the website and the search bar is not in your face, yet still easily findable. The light blue color palette is very pleasing, especially after looking at Maryland. There’s this photo of a mountain, split into 3 different sections, with each section labeled with a broad group of people, one being visitors. I like this a lot because I feel like I can just click one button that is visible right off the bat, depending on whether I am a visitor, business, or resident. When I hover over each section, it doesn’t just force me to click on a link, that third of the photo whites out and gives me some suggestions. Below that is the daily news, and below is a section called services, which provides a more detailed selection of services broken up into different sections that are easy to navigate. Below that is a whole section on the Alaskan government, with categories of agencies on the right, and lists of agencies on the left. They seamlessly transition from one category to the next without clicking on a link to see the different departments. To the right of that are important public notices, and above that is a column of “highlights.” These “highlights” include a photo with bright text that tells you about the highlight. One has a picture of a stick man with a gun, and a fish and hook. You don’t even need to read it to know this is where you go for fishing and hunting,  and the bright large text says, “Buy your license.” There’s a whole column of different “highlights,” and it’s beautifully concise, albeit visually outdated, and makes looking for info on this outdated website a breeze. Clicking buy your license takes you to a different page where license information and the different types of licenses are put under their categories, making what you’re looking for easier to find. The font is still small and basic, however, so it may take a second to find the right license. The bottom of the page includes Alaska’s social media accounts, and after clicking on a few, unlike a lot of states, Alaska updates its social media, and I found this really interesting video on tracking brown bears on their Vimeo, uploaded as early as a year ago. Clicking on the Covid-19 section, it’s clear that this was made more recently. They dropped the light blue color palette with the mountains in favor of dark blue, with very large borders. I’m not a fan of it, but it does include some more modern infographics, has pictures next to the categories to help along the small font, and includes a heatmap of affected areas, or you can switch to a graph of hospitalizations/vaccinations. Alaska’s website is outdated. The small text, the awkward size and shape of the web page, and the low to mid-quality photos scream an old person made this. But for Alaska, I’m impressed with how concise and easy to use this website is in comparison to other outdated, and also newer websites. This website, being as old/simple as it is, makes this the fastest-loading website, and only lagged a little bit when pulling up the third-party COVID heat map. It does take a while to scroll through on mobile, but with the “highlights” section’s photos, as well as the mountain split into three sections, it’s pretty easy to find whatever you’re looking for. Just don’t forget your reading glasses for the rest of the page.  </p>
    

    
<h2>Number 1: <a href="https://portal.kansas.gov/">Kansas.gov</a></h2>
    <p>Finally, in the number one spot, is Kansas. Kansas has the first website I actually like, and I think that the design is beautiful. The search bar is in the top right, and instead in the center is a welcome to Kansas.gov with a photo of the top of their capitol building. This motivates me to keep scrolling, and the second I scroll down, I am confronted with some links for common divisions that each have their own minimalist graphic and react when hovered over. This is great because I don’t want to have to read to get to the most common divisions of a government, such as roads, business and industry, and taxes and finance. From there I can already see in bold lettering, “Let’s explore services and agencies.” I can then click on photos that react when hovered over labels, state agencies, state tourism, and FAQ. I like this simplicity a lot, as it helps take up less space on the front page, which should present information simply in general. Then the website scrolls to a bio of the governor, some fun facts such as 520 square miles are covered by water, which is an important statistic for a state known for being dry. Then there are social media links, extra information such as running background checks, and photos and associated links of some Kansas officials. My big problem is that the social media section is too empty. Most of this website is kept to a minimalist design, that relies on more showing and less telling, which I love. But under the social media section, there’s nothing but a link and then a bunch of wasted space that contributes to the opening webpage feeling a little too long. Once, click on the link to access the page showing the social media, you have to scroll through every department’s and major government official’s social media accounts to try and find what you’re looking for. The top bar with home, government, services, etc. plus the search bar always remains at the top of the page, and when the page is shrunk, it condenses to those three lines at the top left of the page; details like that make this website much easier to use on mobile. I like this color palette a lot as well. White, dark blue and brick red are surprisingly simple and easy to look at seeing as the red compliments the blue backgrounds well, and they complement the white backgrounds, with red never being used too much. Photos move and interact when you scroll and hover over them, and overall, there’s nothing too wrong with this website, and a lot of things that are right, and that is why Kansas.gov is in my number one spot.
