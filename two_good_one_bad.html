    <h1>Two Good Websites and One Bad Website</h1>

    
    <h2>Good Website #1 <a href="https://perkinswill.com/">Perkins&Will</a></h2>
    <p>When it comes to simplicity, the Perkins&Will Architecture firm's website nails it. What I like about the page is how easy it is to look at when I first load the website. It loads quickly and without lag, and when it loads, all you see is all you need. There’s the logo, the button to open up the search bar, and the button that opens up a side menu. Then(without lag) a picture of an architecture project loads in over about a second overlaying the entire page. This high-resolution image that covers my entire computer screen easily fits into the webpage given the simplistic design. The text is white over the photos and fades to black as you scroll to match the background color. This instantly gives you the vibe that this firm offers a sleek and modern take on design that is beautiful and yet easy to take in. Scrolling continues the common trend of showing different articles published by the firm with photos to support them over the white background. The coolest part about the main page is how the main picture that first loads when you open the website changes to a different building designed by that firm each time you load it. Clicking on the links in the side menu brings equally simple webpages following the trend of a sentence/photo covering the top of the webpage, giving you a hint of what you’ll see abstractly and poetically, and then it gets only slightly more complicated as you scroll. There are a couple of issues I found with the website. Each webpage has a considerable amount of white space, which is okay as it continues the simple feel, but it does take a while to scroll down to the bottom of each page. Having a simple design in this way feels like by the time I reach the bottom of the webpage, I’ve forgotten why I’m even there. The code is as the website is, efficient. When opening inspects, it does not take a long time to sift through the code as did other websites I inspected. It uses modern HTML 5 elements such as a head and a body, nav, lots of div, class, NoScript, and so on. It’s efficient and runs well, as clearly the many high-res large photos load quickly and without pause, and there’s only one error caught by Chrome (that being a simple type error).

<h2>Good Website #2: <a href="https://pepsi.com/">Pepsi</a></h2>
    <p>Pepsi’s website is the opposite of Perkins&Will. Loading the website plays an explosive video over my entire screen. Colors splash across the video as Pepsi cans and boxes flow around smoothly and satisfyingly. It loads quickly and has almost zero lag, and for how much is on the screen, it’s impressive. With that said, there’s only one thing on the screen to begin with, it’s the video. As you scroll, there are a few pictures and other videos that span the entire length of the screen, sporting the Pepsi brand and colors so extreme amount. And yet each time a new picture or video pops up as you scroll, it is only showcasing one thing at a time. For example, there’s a bright photo that has a collection of photos showing off a multitude of different Pepsi achievements with the logo in the middle, and while there’s a lot to look at, all that’s said is 125 years. Whoever designed this clearly knows how to combine the volatile marketing Pepsi is going for, while keeping it easy to look at and simply designed. It doesn’t take it too far either. It doesn’t take too long to get to the bottom of the webpage, meaning I can get to the menu at the bottom without forgetting what the webpage I just saw was about. The bar at the top shows where you can buy products and contact Pepsi, and there are more social and menu links at the bottom where you’re expecting them. Something unique about this website is that each social media has its own photo. They’re lined up together and do a little 20-degree twist when hovered over. The colors are consistent with the Pepsi brand, but I have a problem with the top and bottom bars that have a menu of links. The blue they use is much brighter than the blue used in the Pepsi logo. On top of this, to ensure everything that is on screen isn’t assaulting the eyes, the designer used a darker complexion of colors. The bright neon blue is like a slap and it doesn’t fit in with the rest of the webpage. I do like how smooth the videos are, but one of them has a scroll bar and a pause button, which kind of interferes with the smooth transitions between videos and photos. The code is good too. It’s efficient and clearly runs the complex website smoothly. There are a head, body, classes, headers, NoScripts, and other elements that indicate that this uses modern code. There are also notes in the code that tell you where the code for each video is. Overall, a good website that is expected from a brand like Pepsi. </p>
    
    <h2>Bad Website: <a href="https://us.coca-cola.com/">Coca-Cola</a></h2>
    <p>My bad website is Pepsi’s main competitor, Coca-Cola. Not even getting into the web page yet, the first time I looked up Coca-Cola, their website wasn’t even the first that popped up. Opening up the website, it’s clear that there has been much less effort put into the website than the Pepsi website. For such a big company, it’s surprisingly basic. It looks like a mall store website, with some bands of red and white going across the web page. There’s a small slideshow of pictures at the top, scrolling doesn’t take too long to reach the bottom, but it’s just some photos and text within a box on a white background without any effects. The bottom has the social links, as well as a more detailed menu, but it’s still just small text pressed together. The white menu bar that stays at the top of the screen is nicer than the bright blue from Pepsi, but the Pepsi website is just so much more cool, and so much more Pepsi. Take away the Coca-Cola brand from the bottles and I couldn’t tell what website I was looking at. Again, it’s just so basic for such a big company that leaves me thinking, “Is that it?” the whole time. It also annoys me how pressing the shop button takes me to an entirely different website in a different tab that actually has a better structure and color scheme, and looks pretty good. Again, still pretty basic, but that’s what you need for a shop, and the nuanced spacing between the photos and the products makes it much easier to look at. It takes forever to load, and putting the website into mobile causes some lag and can mush text together. The code is up to date, with plenty of elements such as div, head, body, main, class, script, iframe, and others. But the mashed-together feeling of the website makes the code longer and more complicated than the Pepsi website, even though that website is clearly much more to it. An outdated design and clear performance issues, as well as a much superior Website from their main competitor, makes Coca-Cola by bad website. </p>
